            I am a fullstack developer with an interest in AI/ML. I still have a
            lot to learn which is why I am always interested in new
            technologies.

          Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by the power of
          technology to transform ideas into reality. This passion led me to
          pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in
          Business at Arizona State University, where I’ve maintained a perfect
          GPA of 4.0/4.0 and earned spots on the Dean’s List for Fall 2023 and
          Spring 2024.

            I have recently gotten into fashion, a few of my fashion icons are
            @reneerapp, @chael.dot, @diyadabash. I have been actively
            researching queer fashion and its history.

          During my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work on
          several impactful projects and internships. At Jindal Steel and Power
          Ltd, I developed a fullstack application using AngularJS, Spring Boot,
          and SQL that increased data retrieval speed by 15%. I also led a
          project on dispatch optimization and finished goods forecasting,
          utilizing machine learning tools like PyTorch and Sklearn to enhance
          logistics efficiency and accuracy.

          My internship at Ripik.ai allowed me to dive deeper into machine
          learning and data analytics. There, I developed algorithms for slab
          sizing using computer vision techniques with Ultralytics, which
          reduced manual labor and improved measurement accuracy by 25%.

          One of my most rewarding experiences was volunteering with Teach for
          India, where I helped underprivileged students improve their grades by
          an average of 20%. This experience, along with organizing food drives
          and leading cybersecurity information sessions at Carmel Junior
          College, has fueled my passion for using technology to make a positive
          impact.
